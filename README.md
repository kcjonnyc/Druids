# Druids
A 5v5 MOBA style game being developed in the Unity engine and C#. 

Inspired by many of the popular games today, Druids is a MOBA style game with more survival aspects and enviornmental interactions.
The game was designed and modeled in blender, built in the Unity engine and scripted in C#. Character movement, inventory system, main
lighting and day/night cycle have been completed. 

We are currently working on implementing a crafting system and a combat system.
